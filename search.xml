    <content type="text"><![CDATA[This is my first meetup meeting, encouraged by professor Brian. I wouldn’t have known meetup if he didn’t recommend to me. Also, he is the first person who recommended toastmaster, the best club to practice public speaking and critical thinking. My goal is talking to 10 people and ended up at 11, and one resume was sent at last. Things I could have done better: Conduct more research. I only searched for the six startup company. Include the players next time. Limit time for each person in 5mins. If I find out he/she is not the person, try to wrap up the conversation and find next target. Deliver a better pitch. People want to see the real “me”, get a better hook. Think about their pain, ask them and provide your solution. This one really needs time and perspective to achieve, but it can be trained. Overall, it’s a well-organized, vigorous meetup. People who are pursuing the same goal get together. I definitely will go to the next which is more focus on data science part.]]></content>
