At least it’s a start. Took me almost four hours/day to look for a new apartment, including go through Craigslist, send e-mail, and driving to see the area and apartment. It put off other projects, but in the long run, this one week effort can save more time for commute. This week’s activity raises the following question:How to efficiently use fragmented time?

    <title><![CDATA[My First Network Meeting - Boston New Technology Meetup]]></title>
    <url>%2F2017%2F08%2F16%2FMy-First-Network-Meeting-Boston-New-Technology-Meetup%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[This is my first meetup meeting, encouraged by professor Brian. I wouldn’t have known meetup if he didn’t recommend to me. Also, he is the first person who recommended toastmaster, the best club to practice public speaking and critical thinking. My goal is talking with 10 people and ended up at 11, and one resume was sent. I enjoyed the meetup and learned a lot from these wonderful people. However, I could have done better the followings: Conduct more research. I only searched for six startup companies. Include other people next time. Limit time for each person in five mins. If I find out he/she is not my target, try to wrap up the conversation and find next. Deliver a better pitch. People want to see the real “me”, get a better hook. Think about their pain, ask them and provide my solution. This one really needs more time and perspective to achieve, but it can be trained. Overall, it’s a well-organized, vigorous meetup. People who are pursuing the same goal get together. I am looking forward to next meeting.]]></content>

    <title><![CDATA[Blog Intro]]></title>
    <url>%2F2017%2F08%2F14%2FBlog%20Intro%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[In Sitcom Seinfeld, George used to say “it’s about nothing.” Actually doing nothing is doing everything. Wu Wei 无为 is a similar philosophy thought in Dao De Jing[^1]. This blog will be everything, not only about me also others. I want to depict a vivid picture of me; I want to record my presentation in every toastmaster, every piece of music I play; I want to see my spiral growth path when I am doing weekly/monthly/yearly summary; I want to keep every shining idea so I can review and polish it; I want to share my joy and sadness, up and down, success and failure. It will show you the real me. I believe in “If you don’t measure, you cannot improve” and “Facts do not cease exist because they are ignored.” But if you want to measure, you need to find out what to measure first. According to first principle and Dao, a basic, foundational, self-evident proposition or assumption will be the indicator. I will continuously find, measure, improve and train myself. This blog is the perfect place to conduct the field experiment. The world is evolving faster and faster, and We need to grow with it. As a Chinese saying, “It takes a decade to grow a tree, but a century to shape a mankind”, I want to keep moving forward with others and never stop. [^1]:If you are interested in this Chinese philosophy, please read this article Understand Chinese – Dao De Jing Introduction.]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[New StartI am suuuuper excited! The idea starting a blog has been in my mind for a quite while, all kinds of reasons stopped me moving forward, lazy is the most :P. From earliest QQ zone, Renren, to Sina Blog, WeChat, Weibo and recently FB, Twitter…Half of them are already gone, and the left will be gone one day, but the blog will last longer than any of them. This is the mark I want to leave. Please look through Blog Intro for more information about my blog. Thank YouI want to thank the following people for supporting me: Professor Brian enlightened me to start my own brand Fzy-Line, detailed explanation about how to set up Hexo Hexo, a fast, simple &amp; powerful blog framework. Also thanks to my parents forcing me to go abroad :P (they maybe never have a chance to look at this), GitHub for free domain，and the spirit of Internet - sharing. At lastThank all of you who visit my blog. Suggestions are more than welcome. I want to continuously improve and your advice will be truly valuable. Feel free to comment or e-mail me: qunwang.tony@gmail.com.]]></content>
